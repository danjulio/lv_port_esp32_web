# LittlevGL project for ESP32

LittlevGL ported to the ESP32.  
Supported display controllers:
- ILI9341
- ILI9488
- HX8357B/HX8357D

Supported touchscreen controllers:
- XPT2046
- FT3236
- other FT6X36 or the FT6206 controllers should work as well (not tested)
- STMPE610

## Get started 
### Install the ESP32 SDK
http://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Note:

This project is compatible with both the ESP-IDF 3.X branch and the 4.0 branch. For the 4.0 branch, you can use either make or CMake, but CMake is recommended. Instructions here are given for the latest toolchain using `idf.py` (which invokes CMake), but it is easy to translate to make. For example instead of running `idf.py menuconfig`, just run `make menuconfig`.

### Build this repository standalone and run the demo.

Try this first to make sure your hardware is supported, wired and configured properly.

1. Get this project: `git clone --recurse-submodules
https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_port_esp32_ili9341.git`

2. From its root run `idf.py menuconfig`

3. Select your display kit or board and other options - see [config options](#configuration-options)

4. `idf.py build`

5. `idf.py -p (YOUR PORT) flash` (with make this is just `make flash` - in 3.x PORT is configured in `menuconfig`)

### Install this project as a library submodule in your own project

It is recommended to install this repo as a submodule in your IDF project's git repo. The configuration system has been designed so that you do not need to copy or edit any files in this repo. By keeping your submodule directory clean you can ensure reproducible builds and easy updates from this upstream repository.

From your project root:

1. `mkdir -p externals`
2. `git submodule add https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_port_esp32_ili9341.git
externals/lv_port_esp32_ili9341`
3. `git submodule update --init --recursive`
4. Edit your CMake or Makefile to add this repo's components folder to the IDF components path.


#### CMake

The examples below are taken from the ESP-IDF [blink](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/get-started/blink) example which you can copy and use as the basis for your own project.
The project root CMakeLists.txt file needs one line added, just before the project to add the extra components directory to the path like this:

```cmake
#CMakeLists.txt
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)

include($ENV{IDF_PATH}/tools/cmake/project.cmake)

set(EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS externals/lv_port_esp32_ili9341/components)

project(blink)
```

In the CMakeLists.txt file for your `/main` or for the component(s) using LVGL you need to add REQUIRES directives for this project's driver and lvgl itself to the `idf_component_register` function e.g.

```cmake
#main/CMakeLists.txt
idf_component_register(
    SRCS "blink.c"
    INCLUDE_DIRS "."
    REQUIRES lvgl_ili9341 lvgl
)
```

#### Makefile
If you are using make, you only need to add the EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS in the root Makefile of your project:
```Makefile
PROJECT_NAME := blink
EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS := externals/lv_port_esp32_ili9341/components

include $(IDF_PATH)/make/project.mk
```

## Configuration options
There are a number of configuration options available, all accessed through `idf.py menuconfig` -> Components -> LittlevGL (LVGL).

![Main Menu](images/menu-main.png)
![Component Menu](images/menu-component.png)
![Component Menu](images/menu-lvgl.png)

Options include:
 * Display resolution - set the height and width of the display
 * Touch controller present
 * Invert display - if text and objects are backwards, you can enable this
 * Enable backlight control via GPIO (vs hardwiring on)
 * Backlight active high or low - some displays expect a high (1) signal to enable backlight, others expect (low) (default) - if your backlight doesn't come on try switching this

### Assign the correct pinout depending on your ESP32 dev board
There are several development boards based on the ESP32 chip, make sure you assign the correct pin numbers to the signals that interface with the TFT display board. Its recommended to use a predefined configuration below, but you can also set individual pins for both display controller and touch controller.

![Pins](images/menu-pins.png)
![Pins](images/menu-pins-tp.png)

### Predefined Display Configurations

![Predefines](images/menu-predefined-displays.png)

For development kits that come with a display already attached, all the correct settings are already known and can be selected in `menuconfig` from the first option "Select predefined display configuration." Once selected all the other options will be defaulted and won't appear in the menu.

Boards we currently have defined this way are:

### ESP-Wrover-Kit v4.1

![Example GUI with LittlevGL on ESP32](images/esp_wrover_kit.jpg)

This board comes with an embedded TFT screen with the **ILI9341** display driver and it doesn't have touch screen. The screen size is 320 x 240 px.

### M5Stack

![Example GUI with LittlevGL on ESP32](images/m5stack.jpg)

This board comes with an embedded TFT screen with the **ILI9341** display driver and it doesn't have touch screen. The screen size is 240 x 320px.

## Predefined Board Pinouts

![Predefines](images/menu-predefined.png)

When wiring the display and touchpad (if applicable) it is best to use the board's designated HSPI and VSPI pins to take advantage of the hardware SPI support. Several board configurations are available; select the appropriate board in the "Select predefined board pinouts" menu in `menuconfig` and then wire the display and touchpad accordingly.

## ESP32 Dev Board with 38 GPIOs

## Sparkfun ESP32 Thing Plus with Adafruit 3.5" 480x320 TFT Featherwing

[Sparkfun ESP32 Thing Plus](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15663)

[Adafruit 3.5" 480x320 TFT Featherwing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3651)

![Sparkfun and Adafruit - together at last!](images/sparkfun_adafruit.png)

The Adafruit Featherwing board uses a HX8357D TFT display controller and a STMPE610 resistive touch controller.  Both are hardwired to the same SPI bus necessitating the use of a mutex to prevent the display update from interrupting an access to the touch controller and confusing it.  The TFT reset and backlight pins are not connected (hardwired on the Featherwing).  There is no touchpad IRQ.  These signals are connected to unused signals in the following configuration.

## Other Boards

Of course, all the individual pins can be configured in `menuconfig` if the available prefines don't match your board or project requirements. By default the prefined options are disabled and pin settings for the 30 pin dev board are defaulted.
